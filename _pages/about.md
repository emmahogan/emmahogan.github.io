I am a Computer Science doctoral student at University of California, San Diego, working on [improving computer science education in prisons](https://emmahogan.github.io/projects/1_project/). My advisors are Leo Porter, Bill Griswold, and Gerald Soosai Raj, all in the [Computing Education lab](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/cs-ed-research-group/home?authuser=0). My research has involved teaching computer science courses in a college-in-prison program, and conducting research on the effectiveness of strategies used to adapt to the limitations and affordances of the prison environment. A large part of my research is understanding incarcerated students' experiences in CS courses, and learning from them about how to help them succeed. Therefore, I specialize in qualitative research methods and ground my work in asset-based frameworks of education for diverse learners (i.e., Culturally Relevant Education, computing in context, andragogy).

As a member of the [Computing Education lab](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/cs-ed-research-group/home?authuser=0), I have worked on other innovations in computing education such as Live Coding, understanding the experiences of non-majors, and incorporating culturally relevant techniques in CS. In the future, I plan to continue teaching and researching computer science education in prisons at the college-level.
