I am excited to share this post from the UC San Diego newsletter about my research and the good news of my Ford Foundation Fellowship. I feel so grateful to be able to do this work and for everyone who has guided and supported me on this path -- especially my advisors in the Computing Education Lab at UC San Diego, and my former professors and mentors at Siena College who encouraged me to pursue my Ph.D. combining my computer science major with my interest in improving correctional education.

I am looking forward to teaching Introduction to Python Programming for a new group of UC Irvine LIFTED students in the prison this Fall!
