This report describes the design and execution of a college level introductory computing course conducted with 26 students currently incarcerated at a prison in the United States in Fall 2022. We discuss the ways that the prison environment and the student body differ from traditional college computing classes, and how this impacted the design and execution of the course. We found that despite significant environmental barriers to learning to program, such as not having access to a code interpreter, there were unique affordances of the student population, including maturity and community, that could be leveraged in the course design and policies.

Live coding is a teaching method in which an instructor dynamically writes code in front of students in an effort to impart skills such as incremental development and debugging. By contrast, traditional, static-code examples typically involve an instructor annotating or explaining components of pre-written code. Despite recommendations to use live coding and a wealth of qualitative analyses that identify perceived learning benefits of it, there are a lack of empirical evaluations to confirm those learning benefits, especially with respect to students’ programming processes. Objectives. Our work aims to provide a holistic, empirical comparison of a live-coding pedagogy with a static-code one. We evaluated the impact of a live-coding pedagogy on three main areas: 1) students’ adherence to effective programming processes, 2) their performance on exams and assignments, and 3) their lecture experiences, such as engagement during lecture and perceptions of code examples. Method. In our treatment-control quasi-experimental setup, one lecture group saw live-coding examples while the other saw only static-code ones. Both lecture groups were taught by the same instructor, were taught the exact same content, and completed the same assignments and exams. We collected compilation-level programming process data, student performance on exam and homework questions, and feedback via a survey and course evaluations. Findings. Our findings showed no statistically significant differences between the live-coding and static-code groups on programming process metrics related to incremental development, debugging, and productivity. Similarly, there was no difference between the groups on course performance on assignments and exams. Finally, student feedback suggests that more students in the live-coding group reported that lectures were too fast and failed to facilitate note-taking, potentially mitigating the perceived benefits of live coding. Implications. Live coding alone may not lead to many of the perceived and intended benefits that prior work identifies, but future work may investigate how to realize these benefits while minimizing the drawbacks we identified.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="shah_impact_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Impact of a Remote Live-Coding Pedagogy on Student Programming Processes, Grades, and Lecture Questions Asked</div> <div class="author"> Anshul Shah ,  Vardhan Agarwal ,  Michael Granado , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

However, only a few studies have evaluated the effect of live coding on student learning in a controlled experiment and most of the literature relating to live coding identifies students’ perceived benefits of live-coding examples. In order to empirically evaluate the impact of live coding, we designed a controlled experiment in a CS1 course taught in Python at a large public university. In the two remote lecture sections for the course, one was taught using live-coding examples and the other was taught using static-code examples. Throughout the term, we collected code snapshots from students’ programming assignments, students’ grades, and the questions that they asked during the remote lectures. We then applied a set of process-oriented programming metrics to students’ programming data to compare students’ adherence to effective programming processes in the two learning groups and categorized each question asked in lectures following an open-coding approach. Our results revealed a general lack of difference between the two groups across programming processes, grades, and lecture questions asked. However, our experiment uncovered minimal effects in favor of the live-coding group indicating improved programming processes but lower performance on assignments and grades. Our results suggest an overall insignificant impact of the style of presenting code examples, though we reflect on the threats to validity in our study that should be addressed in future work.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="sharma_engagement_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Engagement and Anonymity in Online Computer Science Course Forums</div> <div class="author"> Mrinal Sharma ,  Hayden McTavish ,  Zimo Peng , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 7 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '7 more authors' ?

Previous work has shown that women in computer science tend to use anonymity more often than men on these boards, a trend not found in humanities, social science or business courses. In this work, we build on these findings using an intersectional lens, analyzing both gender and race/ethnicity. We find this combined analysis reveals differences in anonymity that are not apparent when examining gender alone. For example, we find a significantly greater difference in anonymity use between Hispanic men and women than would be expected from analyzing race/ethnicity and gender independently. We additionally analyze type of content (e.g., questions, answers), course, platform, and data source to characterize the many factors at play in measuring students’ choice to participate anonymously. In doing so, we show that different approaches used in prior work for eliciting information on gender — whether using registrar data, a survey, or imputing gender based on name — changes how over 20% of students are classified, particularly affecting nonbinary students and Asian students. Understanding when students participate anonymously can help educators and platform designers to make students’ experience of online discussion boards more welcoming.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">Theses</h2> <h3 class="bibliography">2021</h3> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hogan_role_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Role of Technology in Supporting the Learning Needs of All Levels of Incarcerated Students: A Supplement, not a Replacement</div> <div class="author"> <em>Emma Hogan</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> Aug 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://cdm15739.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15739coll1/id/337/rec/1" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This research contributes to answering this question of how to improve correctional education by defining the role of technology in its ideal implementation, in order to maximize the impact of education for as many incarcerated learners as possible.

However, the academic literature has largely omitted security teams, particularly in crowd work contexts. As such, we know very little about how distributed security teams organize, collaborate, and what technology needs they have. We fill this gap by conducting focus groups with the top five teams (out of 18,201 participating teams) of a computer security Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competition. We find that these teams adopted a set of strategies centered on specialties, which allowed them to reduce issues relating to dispersion, double work, and lack of previous collaboration. Observing the current issues of a model centered on individual workers in security crowd work platforms, our study cases that scaling security work to teams is feasible and beneficial. Finally, we identify various areas which warrant future work, such as issues of social identity in high-skilled crowd work environments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">presentation</h2> <h3 class="bibliography">2024</h3> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hogan_uncovering_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Uncovering Meaningful Computing Contexts for Incarcerated College Students</div> <div class="author"> <em>Emma Hogan</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> Jan 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://cseopenhouse.ucsd.edu/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/Hogan_CSE_Research_Open_House_2024.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Higher education is expanding in United States prisons, with a growing demand for STEM offerings. Academics from other disciplines have stressed the importance of culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) in prison higher education, and computing in context has shown major benefits in CS1— especially for women and nontraditional students. More work is needed to determine what contexts are relevant to incarcerated college students, and how to incorporate these into computing curricula. In this paper, we build on prior work on computing in context and culturally relevant techniques in computing. We analyze course data from a CS1 course taught in a college-in-prison program to answer the following research question: What contexts do incarcerated students in CS1 find relevant? We identify 24 topics pursued by students across 78 open-ended programming assignment submissions, the three most popular being business management, sports statistics, and physical health. These results offer insight into potential contexts that are meaningful to incarcerated college students to be incorporated into future computing curricula and interventions in prisons.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h3 class="bibliography">2023</h3> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hogan_challenges_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Challenges and Approaches to Teaching Computing in Prison</div> <div class="author"> <em>Emma Hogan</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> Nov 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.higheredinprison.org/info/2023-nchep-schedule" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/Hogan%20NCHEP%20Presentation%20Slides.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Computer science (CS), and STEM fields in general, historically exclude people from underserved communities, who are overrepresented in the prison population. In higher education programs in prison, offerings of STEM courses are often limited, posing unique challenges to providing the same educational quality as found on traditional college campuses. For CS courses, technology infrastructure and policies make it difficult for instructors to make essential tools – such as code interpreters where students can run code – available to students. This puts students in computing courses at an undeniable disadvantage, as so much of the learning process of writing code is by doing: running code, understanding the output, and adjusting based on any errors. While students do not have access to technological tools and software needed for their education, instructors will have difficulty closing the gap between incarcerated and non-incarcerated students’ success. During this talk, I will share my experience as a CS instructor in prison, and discuss the barriers to learning computing in prison settings. I will also discuss practical solutions I have found to be effective, as well as ideas I have planned for future iterations of this course.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hogan_cs0_2023-1" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">CS0 vs. CS1: Understanding Fears and Confidence amongst Non-majors in Introductory CS Courses</div> <div class="author"> <em>Emma Hogan</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> Mar 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://sigcse2023.sigcse.org/details/sigcse-ts-2023-papers/143/CS0-vs-CS1-Understanding-Fears-and-Confidence-amongst-Non-majors-in-Introductory-CS" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/slides%20CS0%20vs.%20CS1_%20SIGCSE%202023%20Presentation.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Previous research has been devoted to improving the experience of non-majors in introductory CS courses.
