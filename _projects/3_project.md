At Siena College, I had the opportunity to complete an undergraduate thesis as part of the Standish Honors program. I gained valuable practical experience as part of this work: performing a literature review, working through an IRB approval (which poses particular challenges when working with incarcerated individuals!), and building an Android app from scratch. Throughout the process, I was supported by many amazing mentors, including nearly the entire computer science department. In particular, Annie Rody-Wright, my undergraduate thesis advisor, was and continues to be an amazing role model and partner. 

#### Here are some highlights from this project:

<ul>
    <li>Designed and conducted independent multidisciplinary research project on the role of
technology in supporting the unique needs of incarcerated students with literacy
issues, learning disabilities, and other barriers to traditional classroom settingsh</li>
    <li>Created a working digitalized version of the standard GED preparation classes, to be
used on the tablets at Albany County Jail</li>
    <li>Conducted an anonymous survey of inmates at Albany County Jail comparing their
educational experience in person and on the tablets, analyzed and disseminated
findings as part of my culminating thesis paper</li>
</ul>
