My grandparents on my mom's side were amazing gardeners, and starting my own is one of the many things I do that I learned from them.

It started with this diagram below, which I sketched based on the lists of which plants like or don't like each other in a book called "The Vegetable Gardener's Bible" (gifted to me from my mom!)

My now fiance, Andrew, and I broke ground on the first garden bed in September 2022. The previous owners of this house had also had a garden bed here at some point, but hadn't kept up with it. However, before they left they passed on the wisdom to lay down chicken wire below any beds we built to keep out the groundhogs!

    </div>

Then, we built the second garden bed next to it in October.

The two beds stayed this way for a while, and I slowly filled in the plants in their spots amongst friends (plant friends, of course...)

In late June, we successfully made the original dream from the sketch come to life by building an arched trellis between the two garden beds, tall enough for us to walk under.

The tallest climber of the trellis ended up being cocktail tomatoes, seen here fully reaching the top of the arch in late August. I didn't have as much luck as I'd hoped with other climbing plants, but after working on building up my soil during the winter I have high hopes for next summer!
