This post summarizes research that I conducted alongside Ruoxuan Li and Gerald Soosai Raj. Read the full paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3545945.3569865">here</a>

In this project, we collected survey data from over 500 non-majors in two different introductory CS courses at UCSD: CS0, and CS1. This data included both self-reported confidence levels (on a Likert scale of 1-5), as well as open-ended textual responses about what their fears were going into the course. We used the following mixed-methods to answer several research questions regarding these aspects of their experience in the course:

    </div>

In our qualitative analysis, we thematically coded the students' open ended responses and identified the following fears:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/cs0vscs1/fears_table.png" title="Student fears" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

In addition, when comparing students' reported change in confidence (difference between their reported confidence the first and last weeks), we found a statistically significant difference between the two courses.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/cs0vscs1/confidence_results.png" title="Difference in changes in confidence between the two courses" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Finally, we looked at possible connections between students' change in confidence and their fears going into the course. The figure below shows the results for each of the courses.
